# QUESTIONS ALONG SOLUTION

1. **What is JavaScript and what are its key features?**

Solution: JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is commonly used for creating interactive client-side web applications. Its key features include:

- Dynamically typed: data types are determined at runtime
- Event-driven: programming paradigm that is based on triggering and handling events
- Object-oriented: programming paradigm that is based on objects and classes
- Functional: programming paradigm that is based on functions
- Interpreted: code is executed without needing to be compiled beforehand

1. **What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript?**

Solution: Undefined and null are both JavaScript primitives that represent absence of a value. The key difference is that undefined is used when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value, while null is used when a variable has been intentionally assigned no value.

1. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**

Solution: The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the call stack and task queue to see if there are any tasks waiting to be executed. If the call stack is empty, it will pick up the first task from the task queue and execute it. This allows for non-blocking, asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

1. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript?**

Solution: Synchronous programming is when code is executed one line at a time, in order. Asynchronous programming is when code is executed independently of the main program flow. Asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking operations, which means that the program can continue to run while waiting for an operation to complete.

1. **What is scope in JavaScript and how does it work?**

Solution: Scope in JavaScript refers to the visibility of variables in different parts of the code. There are two types of scope: global and local. Global scope refers to variables that can be accessed from anywhere in the code, while local scope refers to variables that are only accessible within a specific function or block of code.

1. **What is closure in JavaScript and how does it work?**

Solution: A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) function, even after the outer function has returned. Closures are created when a function returns another function, and the returned function has access to variables in the outer function's scope. This allows for data privacy and helps prevent namespace pollution.

1. **What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?**

Solution: **`let`** and **`const`** are block-scoped variables that were introduced in ES6, while **`var`** is function-scoped. **`let`** variables can be reassigned, while **`const`** variables cannot be reassigned.

1. **What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?**

Solution: **`==`** is the loose equality operator, which compares values for equality after converting data types if necessary. **`===`** is the strict equality operator, which compares values for equality without converting data types.

1. **What is the difference between call, apply, and bind in JavaScript?**

Solution: **`call()`** and **`apply()`** are methods that allow you to call a function with a specified **`this`** value and a set of arguments. **`call()`** takes arguments as a comma-separated list, while **`apply()`** takes arguments as an array. **`bind()`** is a method that returns a new function with the specified **`this`** value, which can be called later.

1. **What are higher-order functions in JavaScript and how are they used?**

Solution: A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result. They are used to compose and abstract functionality in a more modular and reusable

1. **What is hoisting in JavaScript and how does it work?**

Solution: Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means that you can use a variable or function before it has been declared, although it is considered best practice to declare them before use to avoid confusion.

1. **What is the prototype chain in JavaScript and how does it work?**

Solution: The prototype chain is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every object in JavaScript has a prototype property, which refers to its parent object. If a property or method is not found in the current object, JavaScript will look for it in the object's prototype chain until it reaches the top of the chain (usually **`Object.prototype`**).

1. **What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in JavaScript?**

Solution: A shallow copy creates a new object with the same references to nested objects as the original object. This means that changes to the nested objects will affect both the original and the copied object. A deep copy creates a new object with completely new references to nested objects, so changes to the nested objects will not affect the original object.

1. **What is the spread syntax in JavaScript and how is it used?**

Solution: The spread syntax is a JavaScript feature that allows an iterable such as an array or string to be expanded into multiple elements. It is denoted by three dots **`...`** and can be used for function calls, array literals, and object literals.

1. **What is a callback function in JavaScript and how is it used?**

Solution: A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after a certain task has been completed. They are commonly used for asynchronous operations in JavaScript, such as making HTTP requests or setting timeouts.

1. **What is a Promise in JavaScript and how is it used?**

Solution: A Promise is a JavaScript object that represents a value that may not be available yet, but will be resolved in the future. Promises allow for asynchronous operations to be handled in a more elegant and readable way, by chaining **`then()`** methods for successful resolution and **`catch()`** methods for error handling.

1. **What is async/await in JavaScript and how is it used?**

Solution: Async/await is a modern JavaScript feature that allows for asynchronous operations to be written in a more synchronous style. The **`async`** keyword is used to define a function as asynchronous, and the **`await`** keyword is used to wait for the resolution of a Promise. Async/await is often considered more readable and maintainable than using Promises alone.

1. **What is the difference between an arrow function and a regular function in JavaScript?**

Solution: Arrow functions are a newer syntax for defining functions in JavaScript. They are shorter and more concise than regular functions, and have a more predictable **`this`** value. Arrow functions do not have their own **`this`** value, so they always use the **`this`** value of their enclosing scope.

1. **What is destructuring in JavaScript and how is it used?**

Solution: Destructuring is a JavaScript feature that allows you to extract values from objects and arrays and assign them to variables. It can be used to extract specific values from an object or array, and can also be used in function parameters to make the code more readable.

1. **What is the difference between the var, let, and const keywords in JavaScript?**

Solution: **`var`** is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned. **`let`** and **`const`** are block-scoped and cannot be redeclared in the same block, but **`let`** variables can be reassigned while **`const`** variables cannot be reassigned. Best practice is to use `let
